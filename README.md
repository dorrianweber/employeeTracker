## The Assignment
Create a command line application where a user can access information about a network of employees using various options from their main menu.

## Looking Forward
I would like to go in and add some more of the functions reccommended for "bonus points" in the assingment details. Deleting employees, viewing total cost of salaries for all employees within a given department, etc. I also should add some validation for the various inputs (making sure "salary" is a number with at least 5 digits, capitalization, trimming off spaces at the ends of string inputs, etc.)
